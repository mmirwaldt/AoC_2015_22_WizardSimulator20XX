This is a repository where I solve the puzzle of advent of code, year 2015, day 22:
Wizard Simulator 20XX
See https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/22 for the puzzle

I must confess I was not able to solve part 2 of this puzzle without help :-(
I found a solution on https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/3xspyl/day_22_solutions/cy86y2x/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
and compared the results to my code.
I had to notice that my code was not able to continue a spell without a break.
That was irrelevant for part one but relevant for part two.
The two examples given in the description of the puzzle didn't cover that case
so I was not able to notice I did not understand what was meant with
"You cannot cast a spell that would start an effect which is already active.
However, effects can be started on the same turn they end."
I wished an example would have clarified that.
